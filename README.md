#Full-Stack Web Application with React, Node.js, and MS SQL

#Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive full-stack web application designed to demonstrate proficiency in modern web development technologies. The application uses React for the front-end, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MS SQL for data storage and management, ensuring a reliable and scalable database solution.

The front-end is built with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and jQuery to provide a responsive and interactive user experience. The back-end is responsible for handling user authentication, dynamic data processing, and RESTful API integration.
